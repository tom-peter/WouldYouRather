# 'Would you rather?' Project

This is my assessment project for the React-Redux part of Udacity's React NanoDegree program. 

In this project, I have created a React application from scratch, utilized React components and React Router to manage the user interface, and used asynchronous events, middlewares and Redux store for state management.

The App is a “Would You Rather?” game. 

The game goes like this: 
A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. 

In the app:
 -	users are be able to answer questions, 
 -	see which questions they haven’t answered, 
 -	see how other people have voted, 
 -	post questions, and 
 -	see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

Please note, that the App uses a fake database, since the course is focusing on Front End development with React and Redux.

## To get started

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
